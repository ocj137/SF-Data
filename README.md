# SF-Data

San Francisco provides a wealth of data on the city for public use. This project explores this data and modeles interesting relationships with regression.

some notes on the data used

I have gone through the above website and pulled out a variety of different datasets that we think are particularly interesting. Some of the datasets are from external sources as well, but all are related to San Francisco. A high level overview of data folders is provided after the project requirements section.
There is a lot of different data. The point of the project is to focus on aspects of San Francisco that are particularly interesting to me from a modeling point of view.
The uncompressed data is a large filesize. Even the compressed data is pretty large. The data is compressed into a .7z format which has one of the smallest filesizes available.

Recommended Utilities for .7z files
For OSX Keka or The Unarchiver.
For Windows 7-zip is the standard.
For Linux try the p7zip utility.  sudo apt-get install p7zip.
